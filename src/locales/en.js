  historyTitle: 'Love Is a Right, Not a Trend',
  historyDetails: `<p>While over <b>60 countries</b> still criminalize homosexuality (and same-sex marriage remains illegal in much of the world), <b>Spain became a global leader in LGBTQ+ rights</b>. In <b>2005</b>, it became the <em>third country in the world</em> to legalize same-sex marriage, granting full rights, including adoption, to gay and lesbian couples.</p><p>The law was pushed by <b>Prime Minister Zapatero</b> <b>(PSOE)</b>, and faced strong resistance from the <b>Popular Party (PP)</b> and the <b>Catholic Church</b>. Since then, over <b>70,000 same-sex couples</b> have married in Spain.</p><p>Before 2005, couples used legal tools like <em>power of attorney</em> and <em>civil unions</em> to access limited rights. In rare cases, individuals <em>changed legal gender to marry their partner</em>. Others adopted each other's children individually. These were <b>fragile, often painful workarounds to access rights heterosexual couples took for granted</b>.</p><p>Today, Spain remains progressive, but <b>far-right parties</b> are pushing for a return to <em>"traditional values."</em> Their agenda threatens hard-won LGBTQ+ rights under the disguised of <em>"protecting families."</em> Similar rollbacks have occurred in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12302509/Italy-erases-names-gay-mothers-childrens-birth-certificates-crackdown.html">Italy</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/attacks-on-gay-rights-push-russias-lgbtq-community-into-the-shadows-3b5e417e">Russia</a>, and some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/lawmakers-9-states-propose-measures-undermine-sex-marriage-rights-rcna193743">U.S. states</a>, where same-sex couples have seen protections stripped away. <b>The progress achieved is significant, but not irreversible</b>.</p>`,
